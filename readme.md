## Exercise

Today, you learned about Insertion Sort. So tonight, you will be practicing it more.

Come up with two sets of numbers and sort them. These sets of numbers must have at least 5 numbers and cannot already be sorted beforehand. Also, they cannot be any sets of numbers we used during class.

Just like the [Bubble and Insertion Sort Lab](https://github.com/ga-adi-nyc/Sorting-Algorithms-Lab), sort as many as you can and make sure to show your work.

Show the result the sort after each pass.

#### Requirements

Provide the results of each pass. You can either take photos of the individual results that were written on paper or you can type them in a text file; both options are fine.

**Bonus:**

Sort the following string, using Insertion sort:

> G, e, n, E, R, a, L

#### Deliverable

A file or photos detailing all of the results.
